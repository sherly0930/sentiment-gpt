# Sentiment Analysis of Product Reviews Using GPT API

This is my research-based final-year project (FYP) that performs sentiment analysis on Amazon mobile electronics reviews using advanced ML model - GPT model, which is accessible through GPT API. The sentiment prediction process is automated to analyze, infer, and classify the product reviews as either **Positive** or **Negative** purely based on the review text, ensuring that it is not misled by the potentially incorrect star ratings.
